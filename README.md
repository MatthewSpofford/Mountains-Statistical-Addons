# Mountains Statistical Addons
## About
This is a multiscale analysis addon developed to integrate directly with MountainsMapÂ® (developed by [Digital Surf](https://www.digitalsurf.com/)) to act as a 'study' tool.
It uses length-scale, area-scale, or area-complexity analysis on a given set of surfaces.
The application can then be used to run multiscale regression or discrimination on the exported surface data using F-tests, T-Tests, or ANOVA analysis.

The previous iteration of this project was a [standalone application](https://github.com/MatthewSpofford/Multiscale-Statistical-Analysis) develpoed by [Nathaniel Rutkowski](https://github.com/nrutkowski1). In order to improve the user experience, this addon application was created.
